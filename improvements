Job based creep scheduler
    - priority queues (could be multiple queues in memory or a big dict)
    - creeps have set roles, and dont switch, they are just assigned jobs

Creep Types
    - 3 Miner (nWORK 1CARRY 1MOVE) sits at resource, mines, empties into
        - container, scale up parts until source depletes before
            regeration, if cant scale, generate at most 2
    - 3 Upgrader (nWORK 1CARRY 1MOVE) sits at room controller, fills from
        contaier, and transfers energy to controller.
        - scale up parts until extentions insufficient to keep container
            filling, if cant scale high enough, generate at most 8
    - 1 Repairer (1WORK 1CARRY 2MOVE-static ratio) fills from container,
        repairs structures - mostly redundant after tower
        - should only need 1 per room, only generate as needed
    - 3 Carrier (4CARRY 4MOVE-static ratio) transfers energy from mining
        container to other containers and extentions
        - scale up until miner containers no longer fill
    - 1 Builder/Harvester (1WORK 1CARRY 2MOVE-static ratio) builds
        structures, harvests energy in early game
        - harvesters, generate at most (free mining spots * 1.5)
        - builders, generate 1 per construction site, at most 4

Structure layout
    - Containers (1 per source, 1 on controller)
        high priority - possible automated placing
    - Extentions (diagonally alternating, spread around spawner)
        highest priority - possible automated placing
    - Roads (1 lane wide connecting all containers bach to spawner
        lowest priority route calculated at construction time
